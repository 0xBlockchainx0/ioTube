# ioTube Token submission

<!--
## Introduction

ioTube is a two-way, multi-asset, cross-chain protocol bridging IoTeX 
to other blockchains such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and others. 
Anyone can submit their token to be added to ioTube: if you deployed a token 
on IoTeX, you can make your dApp cross-chain and reach the audience of other 
popular chains. Likewise, if you have deployed your token on Ethereum or any 
blockchain other than IoTeX, thanks to ioTube you can extend your dApp to the 
IoTeX ecosystem, taking advantage of the 5-second tx confirmations, ultra-low fees,
and access other unique IoTeX features like real-world IoT data oracles, etc..

## Guidelines for tokens
We will only take into consideration projects that show clear signs of activity: 
either traffic on the network, activity on GitHub, or community buzz.

- The icon should be small, square, but high resolution, ideally a vector/svg.
- Make sure your website includes a detailed explanation of project and the token contract address.
- No Profanity in token name, token description, etc.

Please fill the data below for us to review your submission and reach out to you 
for more information.

## If your token is native on IoTeX
<!-- If your token is not native on IoTeX, please skip this section and move to the next one. -->

<!-- Set your token contract address on the IoTeX blockchain -->
- IoTeX Token contract address: <contract address>

<!-- Select which chains you want to bridge to -->
**Bridge to:**
* [x] IoTeX → Ethereum
* [ ] IoTeX → Binance Smart Chain
* [ ] IoTeX → Polygon
* [ ] IoTeX → Huobi Eco Chain (coming soon)

## If your token is native on a different chain
<!-- Please select the tokens you want to bridge to IoTeX, along with the contract address for each one -->

* [x] Ethereum → IoTeX: <token contract address on Ethereum>
* [ ] Binance Smart Chain → IoTeX: <token contract address on BSC>
* [ ] Polygon → IoTeX: <token contract address on Polygon>
* [ ] Huobi Eco Chain (coming soon) → IoTeX: <token contract address on HEC>
